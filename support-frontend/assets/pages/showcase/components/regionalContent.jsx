        The Guardian is committed to holding power to account &mdash; from our reporting on&#32;
        the Windrush revelations to the Cambridge Analytica scandal &mdash; while keeping the climate emergency&#32;
        front and centre. We will continue to report on the fallout from the EU referendum, the immigration&#32;
        crisis, and data privacy issues. We remain dedicated to truth, to giving a voice to those&#32;
        who have gone unheard, and to helping bring about a more hopeful future.

        <i>Guardian Australia</i> has made the climate emergency a top editorial priority, covering issues from the&#32;
        management of the Murray-Darling basin, to farming in a changing climate, and disappearing species across&#32;
        the nation. Our political team in Canberra continues to report on the issues of the day and, across&#32;
        Australia, our award-winning coverage of Indigenous affairs and immigration issues remains core to our work.
