        If you pay at least
         
        £12 per month
        , you will receive the 
        All-access digital
         benefits on a subscription basis. If you increase your payments per
         
        month
        , these additional amounts will be separate 
        monthly
         voluntary financial contributions to the Guardian. The 
        All-access digital
         subscription and any contributions will auto-renew each
         
        month
        . You will be charged the subscription and contribution amounts using your chosen payment method at each renewal unless you cancel. You can cancel your subscription or change your contributions at any time before your next renewal date. If you cancel within 14 days of taking out a 
        All-access digital
         
        subscription, you’ll receive a full refund (including of any contributions) and your subscription and any contribution will stop immediately. Cancellation of your subscription (which will also cancel any contribution) or cancellation of your contribution made after 14 days will take effect at the end of your current
         
        monthly
         payment period. To cancel, go to
