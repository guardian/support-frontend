## The list of supported browsers is:

* Chrome 38 and above
* Safari 8 and above
* IE 11
* Microsoft Edge all versions
* Firefox 44 and above
* Samsung 4 and above
* Opera 25 and above

Note about Android WebView: If someone reports a issue we are going to fix it but we are not going proactively test it.

### Coverage: 98.08% of our traffic

### Methodology:

Generate a report with GA containing "browser","browser version" and "Sessions".
Include browsers versions until we cover a total of at least **98%** of the total amount of sessions.

We are going to check the list of supported browsers every 6 months. In the case of a dependency dropping support for 
one of our supported browsers we should do this analysis as soon as possible.
